            <h3>Fullstack software developer trainee</h3>
            <p>I like to do something great from almost nothing. I like to do creative things, look for easier ways instead of difficult processes.</p>    
            <p>The well made processes can help us to work more comfortable and these help us to avoide most of the mistakes as well.</p>

            <h3>Premier Observatory</h3>
            <p>Webb will be the premier space observatory for astronomers worldwide, extending the tantalizing discoveries of the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>
            <h3>Largest Telescope in Space</h3>
            <p>Webb will be the largest telescope ever placed in space; 100 times more powerful than Hubble. So big it has to fold origami-style to fit in the rocket and will unfold like a "Transformer" in space.</p>
            <h3>The First Stars and Galaxies</h3>
            <p>With unprecedented infrared sensitivity, it will peer back in time over 13.5 billion years to see the first galaxies born after the Big Bang.</p>
            <h3>How Galaxies Assemble</h3>
            <p>Webb will help astronomers to compare the faintest, earliest galaxies to today's grand spirals and ellipticals, helping us to understand how galaxies assemble over billions of years.</p>
            <h3>Birth of Stars & Planetary Systems</h3>
            <p>Webb will be able to see right through and into massive clouds of dust that are opaque to visible-light observatories like Hubble, where stars and planetary systems are being born.</p>
            <h3>Exoplanets</h3>
            <p>Webb will tell us more about the atmospheres of extrasolar planets, and perhaps even find the building blocks of life elsewhere in the universe. In addition to other planetary systems, Webb will also study objects within our own Solar System.</p>
            <h3>Orbit</h3>
            <p>Webb will orbit the sun, a million miles away from Earth at the second Lagrange point. (L2 is four times further away than the moon!)</p>
            <h3>Launch</h3>
            <p>Webb will launch in 2021 from French Guiana... (The mission lifetime is 5-10+ years.)</p>
            <h3>Build, Integration & Test</h3>
            <p>Webb has over 1200 skilled scientists, engineers and technicians from 14 countries and more than 29 US states as well as the District of Columbia building it. The Team. It is a joint NASA/ESA/CSA mission.</p>
            <h3>Technology Innovations:</h3>
            <p>Webb has created spinoff technologies. (Including a new LASIK-like procedure for your eyes!) </p>
